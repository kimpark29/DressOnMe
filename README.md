# DressOnMe
## Summary
Nowadays, people prefer online shopping rather than going to the physical store directly. However, it can be confusing for someone to choose which clothes to buy when they don’t know how the clothes will look on them. This brings our team a question: “Can people try clothes digitally?”

An augmented reality technology is already developed to allow people to try clothes digitally using the clothes’ 3D model. However, it can be expensive to create a 3D model for small business sellers. This changes our question, “Can people try clothes digitally without a 3D model?”

With these thought in mind, we create DressOnMe is an application where people can try clothes anywhere and anytime, with just a picture of themselves and the picture of desired clothes.
